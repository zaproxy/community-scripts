# A simple plan that performs a full authenticated scan against https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.
# It only uses the standard spider as DVWA is a traditional app.
# The spider will fail the plan if it finds less that 100 URLs as that implies something way wrong.
# Various URLs are excluded to prevent the scan from breaking the app, 
# e.g. by resetting the db or changing the admin password.
